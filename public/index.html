				<p>In a nutshell: The U.S government and its law enforcement would be able to receive mountains of information from companies such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, and also your cell phone carrier simply by requesting it, no subpoena required. They would be able to use the information they gather for whatever purpose was deemed necessary, with NO LEGAL consequence.<br><br>Also important is that the scope of this bill is NOT confined to US residents. The US government would be able to get information about anyone in the world that has a Facebook, Google or Twitter account.</p>
